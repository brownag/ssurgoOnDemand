# ssurgoOnDemand
user driven SSURGO properties and interpretations


THe purpose of these tools are to give users the ability to get Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) properties and interpretations in an efficient manner.  It is very similiar to the United States Department of Agriculture  - Natural Resource Conservation Service's distributed Soil Data Viewer, although there are distinct differences.  The most importatn difference is the data collected with the SSURGO On-Demand (SOD) tools are collecting the information in real-time via web requests to Soil Data Access (https://sdmdataaccess.nrcs.usda.gov/).  SOD tools do not require users to have the data found in a traditional SSURGO download from the NRCS's official repository, Web Soil Survey (https://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/App/HomePage.htm).  Currently, the tools packaged here are designed to run within the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop Application - ArcMap, version 10.1 or greater.  However, much of the Python code is recyclable and could run within a Python intepreter or other GIS applicaations such as Quantum GIS with some modification.

Within the SOD tools are 2 primary toolsets, descibed as follows:
